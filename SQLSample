/*
This analysis is based on shipping data obtained from Mavenanalytics.io
Sales & order data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier, including information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees.
*/
/*
The shipping company wanted to know some key details about its customers:
Who ships the most and who spends the most on average?

Audience: Sales, Account Management, Product Management
Insight: This table can be used to determine specific account/sales strategies for each customer based on unit economics. 
Example: Simons Bistro (SIMOB) has an average spend of $1366 which is near the top for customers but its spend is $0.082/unit freight which is near the bottom.
Although its spend makes it look like SIMOB is a profitable customer, Northwind Traders may be losing money servicing them.

Way forward for further research: What is the average unit cost and What is the profitability for each customer? Is the company losing money by servicing customers with poor unit economics?

What are the annual sales trends by category?
Audience: Executive leadership, product management, finance
Insight: at first it appears that sales spiked in 2014 however, 2013 and 2015 are partial years. 
I would provide the executive team with similar analysis in months or quarters to see better trend analysis.
